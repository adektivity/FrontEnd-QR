## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 3
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was a great way to learn about different methods of centering items on a web page using CSS. Ended up using Grid as it was the most straight-forward way of centering items on the webpage.

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  min-height: 100vh;
  place-items: center;
}
```

I also learned how to scale my website across different screen sizes.

### Continued development

I want to further learn CSS Flexbox and Grid and ways in which they can be used to build better interfaces.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This helped me with different methods of centering elements on a webpage and rendering images properly.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41468951/images-not-displaying-in-github-pages) - This helped me to understand and resolve an issue I had with github pages not displaying the image on my website.
